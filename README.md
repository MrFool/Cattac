Cattac is a casual and cute iOS cat-themed turn based game.

1. Overview

Cattac is a casual and cute cat-themed turn based game, where each player plan their action for the next turn simultaneously. All actions are then executed simultaneously. Gameplay will be on a grid that is square. The grid will be populated with nodes and have a randomly generated level (randomised doodads, events, items e.t.c. on each node) each time the game is played. This ensures that the game does not get stale even with multiple playthroughs with other cats. 
Each cat will be able to perform multiple actions involving moving to another node and/or shooting(e.g. meow/fart) in a direction and/or planting a trap (potentially pooping on a node) which remains invisible until triggered (even to the cat who planted it) for the rest of the game. Because each cat will only know a limited set of information (where other cats are currently, where environmental doodads are, where certain items are), cats will have to predict each other’s moves, avoid bluffs (trap mechanics) and remember where they placed their own traps in order to gain an edge and eventually winning the other cats for the ultimate rat prize. 
This concept is similar to but not exactly like battleship where you know where to aim but not what/who you’re aiming at. Instead, In Cattac, cats know where each other are, but because of the variability of movements, actions, environmental interaction and traps, the actions planned by each cat after trying to predict what happens next might result in very unpredictable yet very fun results (hilarious and fun when playing casually with friends)!
Cattac is a multiplayer game by default, with the option to play with other players online (wireless). Game modes can be free for all or team based, with a maximum of 4-8 players. There will be a time limit imposed for each turn so that the players do not wait forever for everyone to make their moves.
